# Content Creation Guidelines

## Scope Restrictions
- ONLY modify files within the [src/content](mdc:src/content) directory
- DO NOT edit, modify, or touch any files outside the content directory
- DO NOT modify any JavaScript, CSS, HTML, or component files
- DO NOT edit any configuration files or build scripts

## Content Structure
The workshop content is organized in a specific folder structure:

1. Content is organized in numbered module folders (e.g., `01-introduction/`)
2. Each module contains numbered markdown files (e.g., `01-welcome.md`)
3. Both folders and files use the format: `##-name` where ## is a two-digit number

## File Naming Convention
When creating content files:
- Use the pattern `##-descriptive-name.md` (e.g., `01-welcome.md`)
- Always use lowercase kebab-case for filenames
- Ensure the first two digits match the correct sequence

## Adding New Content
To add new content:
1. Determine which module folder it belongs to
2. Use the next available number in sequence for the file
3. The markdown file should start with a level-1 heading (`# Title`)
4. Use proper markdown formatting for sections, code blocks, and links

## Modifying Content
- You can freely edit any existing markdown files within the content directory
- Maintain consistent formatting and structure

## Deleting Content
- You can delete markdown files you no longer need
- The system will automatically update to reflect the deletion
- No additional steps are required after deletion

## Important Notes
- The system dynamically loads content - changes will be visible on refresh
- You can test your changes by clicking "Reload Content" in the sidebar
- Content files are automatically included in the navigation based on their folder location and numbering
