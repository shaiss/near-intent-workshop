# Critique for 02-overview.md (from a Web2 dev new to Web3 perspective)

## Overall Impression

This section dives into the core concepts of NEAR Intents and Smart Wallet Abstraction. It does a decent job of breaking down the components, but a Web2 developer might still struggle with the abstraction levels and the necessity of some components without more relatable analogies or clearer problem statements from a Web2 viewpoint.

## What Doesn't Work / Needs Clarification

1.  **"Paradigm shift in how we think about blockchain interactions"**:

    - **Critique**: Strong statement, but a Web2 dev first needs to understand the _current_ paradigm of blockchain interactions and its pain points to appreciate the shift.
    - **Suggestion**: Before this, briefly state the common Web3 interaction: "Typically, using a blockchain application involves users manually crafting and signing detailed transactions, specifying every step. This can be like writing low-level assembly code for a simple task." Then introduce intents as the paradigm shift: "NEAR Intents change this by allowing users to state their high-level goal..."

2.  **Intent: "Chain-agnostic and outcome-driven"**:

    - **Critique**: "Chain-agnostic" is a Web3 term. While "outcome-driven" is clearer, the combined power needs to be emphasized for a Web2 audience.
    - **Suggestion**: Explain "chain-agnostic": "This means the user's goal isn't tied to a specific blockchain; the system can figure out the best chain(s) to use." Then, connect it to a Web2 analogy: "Imagine wanting to book a flight (the outcome) and an intelligent travel agent (the system) finds the best airline and route, possibly involving multiple carriers, without you needing to specify each one."

3.  **Solver: "Competes to fulfill an intent optimally"**:

    - **Critique**: The concept of "competing" solvers might be new. Why is competition good here? How does it work?
    - **Suggestion**: Explain the benefit of competition: "Multiple 'Solvers' can look at a user's intent and propose different ways to achieve it. They compete to offer the best solution (e.g., best price for a swap, fastest execution). This is like getting quotes from multiple vendors before making a purchase, ensuring you get the best deal."

4.  **Verifier: "Acts as a security layer between intent and execution"**:

    - **Critique**: The security aspect is good, but _what_ is it securing against? What are the risks?
    - **Suggestion**: Elaborate slightly: "Before any Solver's proposed solution is executed, the 'Verifier' checks it against the user's original intent and constraints. This ensures that what the Solver _plans_ to do actually matches what the user _wanted_ and protects the user from malicious or incorrect fulfillment of their intent."

5.  **Smart Wallet: "Abstracts signing, batching, and multi-chain logic" & "Enables gasless transactions and session-based authentication"**:

    - **Critique**: These are powerful features, but a Web2 dev needs to understand the pain points they solve.
      - "Signing": What does typical signing look like and why is abstracting it good?
      - "Batching": Why is this needed?
      - "Multi-chain logic": Again, why is this complex without abstraction?
      - "Gasless transactions": What is "gas"? Why is "gasless" a benefit?
      - "Session-based authentication": How does this compare to Web2 sessions? Current Web3 auth is often per-transaction.
    - **Suggestion**:
      - Briefly explain each problem: "Normally, users have to approve (sign) every single action, pay 'gas' (network fees) for each, and if multiple steps are involved, they do them one by one. If interacting with multiple blockchains, this complexity multiplies."
      - Then explain the benefits: "A Smart Wallet can simplify this by: allowing users to approve a session for a period (like logging into a website), bundling multiple actions into one, managing interactions across different networks seamlessly, and even enabling applications to sponsor network fees so users experience 'gasless' transactions."

6.  **"Traditional blockchain transactions require users to..." vs. "Intents simplify this by..."**:

    - **Critique**: This is a good comparative list. However, some terms in the "Traditional" list might still be Web3 jargon.
      - "Know exact contract addresses": Explain what a contract address is (like an API endpoint for a specific application on the blockchain).
      - "Manage gas fees and limits": Reiterate what gas is.
    - **Suggestion**: Add micro-explanations for the Web3 terms in the "Traditional" list to make the comparison even clearer.

7.  **Workflow Diagram**: `User → UI → Intent Object → Verifier Contract → Solver Submission → Fulfillment Evaluation → Execution on-chain (via Smart Wallet)`

    - **Critique**: The text-based flow is okay, but can be improved. The terms are defined above, but seeing them in sequence is key. The "TBD: add `Actor overview: dApp, User, Verifier, Solver, Relayer`" is important to address.
    - **Suggestion**: Consider using a Mermaid diagram (as per your `mermaid-diagrams` rule) for better visual clarity once the actors are defined. Clearly distinguish between user actions, system components, and on-chain/off-chain parts if possible. The term "Relayer" appears in the TBD, which hasn't been introduced yet – it should be defined if it's part of the core workflow.

8.  **Example Intent (JSON)**:

    - **Critique**: This is good for developers. It makes the concept of an "intent object" concrete.
    - **Suggestion**: No major change, but perhaps add a comment in the JSON or just before it, reiterating what this specific intent means in plain English: "e.g., The user wants to swap 100 USDC for NEAR, and is willing to accept a price slippage of up to 0.5%."

9.  **Benefits (For Users / For Developers)**:

    - **Critique**: These lists are good and generally clear.
    - **Suggestion**: Under "For Users," for "Better prices," briefly link it back to the concept of "competing Solvers." For "Cross-chain capability," remind them it means interacting with multiple blockchains easily.

10. **TBD Note**: `TBD: add Actor overview: dApp, User, Verifier, Solver, Relayer`
    - **Critique**: This is a crucial piece of information that is missing. The term "Relayer" is introduced here without prior definition.
    - **Suggestion**: This should be prioritized. Define each actor and their role. A Web2 developer is used to thinking in terms of user roles and system components. A "Relayer" often plays a key role in gas abstraction and transaction submission, which is very relevant to improving UX from a Web2 perspective.

## How to Present Content Better for a Web2 Developer

- **Reinforce the "Problem"**: Before presenting a Web3 component (Solver, Verifier, Smart Wallet feature), clearly state the problem it solves from a user's (especially a Web2 user's) perspective or a developer's perspective.
- **Layered Explanations**: Introduce concepts at a high level first, then provide more detail. The overview is doing this, but ensure the language remains accessible.
- **Visuals for Flows**: The workflow diagram is a good idea. Making it more visual (e.g., Mermaid) and clearly delineating roles/actors will be very helpful.
- **Define All Terms**: Ensure every non-obvious term (especially Web3-specific or architecture-specific like "Relayer") is defined upon its first significant use.
- **Connect to Benefits**: Continuously tie the technical components back to the user and developer benefits you listed.

Addressing these points will make the overview much more digestible and compelling for a Web2 developer trying to understand the value and mechanics of NEAR Intents.
