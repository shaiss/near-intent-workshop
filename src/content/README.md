## Content Naming Convention

Files within each folder follow this naming convention:

- Files are prefixed with numbers to determine their order (e.g., `01-welcome.md`)
- File names use kebab-case for readability
- Names clearly describe the content of each file

## Adding New Content

When adding new content:

1. Determine which module it belongs to
2. Use the next available number in sequence
3. Follow the file naming convention
4. Update the `index.js` file to include the new content

This structure makes it easy to maintain, edit, and extend the workshop content.
