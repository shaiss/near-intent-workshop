# Critique for Section: 01-introduction

This section primarily contains introductory text and setup instructions. The following points highlight areas for improvement based on the provided coding and content rules.

## File: `src/content/01-introduction/02-overview.md`

1.  **Mermaid Diagram Caption**:

    - **Issue**: The `sequenceDiagram` illustrating the intent workflow lacks a descriptive caption directly beneath it. The `mermaid-diagrams` rule suggests: "Add descriptive captions beneath diagrams."
    - **Expected**: Add a brief caption below the Mermaid diagram to explain its purpose or summarize the flow it depicts. For example: "Figure 1: Typical Intent Workflow involving User, dApp, Verifier, Solver, and Smart Wallet."

2.  **JSON Code Block Comments**:

    - **Issue**: The JSON example for an intent includes a comment (`// Assuming 6 decimals for USDC`) directly within the JSON structure. While some parsers might tolerate this, JSON as a standard does not support comments. The `code-quality-reviewer` rule emphasizes clear comments but embedding them in data structures can be problematic.
    - **Expected**: Place explanatory notes about JSON fields (like the decimal assumption for USDC) in the accompanying markdown text that introduces or explains the JSON example, rather than embedding comments directly within the JSON.

3.  **JSON Magic Strings (Minor/Forward-looking)**:
    - **Issue**: The JSON example uses a string literal `"USDC.token.near"`. While acceptable for a simple introductory example, the `code-quality-reviewer` rule advises against magic numbers/strings in favor of named constants in more complex code.
    - **Expected**: For this introductory example, it's likely fine. However, if this pattern of using literal contract addresses or token IDs persists into more substantial code examples later in the workshop, they should be defined as constants or clearly marked as placeholders that would be configurable in a real application.

1.  **Placeholder Formatting in Shell Commands**:
    - **Issue**: The command `near state yourname.testnet` uses `yourname.testnet` as a placeholder. The `markdown-formatting` rule specifies using `<PLACEHOLDER_NAME>` for placeholders.
    - **Expected**: Change the placeholder `yourname.testnet` to a format consistent with the `markdown-formatting` rule, such as `<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID.testnet>` or `<YOUR_TESTNET_ACCOUNT_ID>`, to clearly indicate it needs to be replaced by the user.
