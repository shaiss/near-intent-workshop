# What's Next?

Now that you've completed the core workshop on NEAR Intents and Smart Wallet Abstraction, it's time to consider how you might apply these concepts to your own projects.

## Exploration Prompts

Consider these questions as you think about applying what you've learned:

- Which of the use cases from the workshop are you most excited to explore?
- Would you build a solver, integrate a smart wallet, or compose a new intent use case?
- What specific UX pain points in your existing dApps could be solved with intents?

## Project Ideas

Here are some practical next steps to continue your development journey:

1. **Build a Custom Solver**
   - Write a solver that interacts with a new DeFi protocol
   - Create specialized solvers for specific user intents

2. **Improve an Existing Project**
   - Clone one of the public Intents DEXs and add a UI feature
   - Add intent capabilities to an existing dApp

3. **Create a Smart Wallet Integration**
   - Build a smart wallet that uses meta-tx + session keys
   - Implement a wallet with allowance-based permissions

4. **Design Cross-Chain Experiences**
   - Create a seamless cross-chain swap UI
   - Build a portfolio manager that works across multiple chains

## Community Engagement

The NEAR ecosystem thrives on community contributions. Consider:

- Joining the NEAR Developer Forum to showcase your results
- Contributing to open-source intents projects
- Providing feedback on the intents specification
- Participating in community hackathons to test your ideas
