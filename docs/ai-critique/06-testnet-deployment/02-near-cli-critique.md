# Critique for 06-testnet-deployment/02-near-cli.md (Web2 dev perspective)

## Overall Impression

This section provides a good overview of how to use NEAR CLI to interact with and test the deployed Verifier and Solver contracts. It covers basic commands, calling contract methods with different parameters, viewing state, and using JSON files for arguments. For a Web2 developer, NEAR CLI is analogous to tools like `curl` for HTTP APIs, or cloud provider CLIs for managing services.

## What Doesn't Work / Needs Clarification

1.  **Basic NEAR CLI Commands**: `near state`, `near tx`, `near keys` are good introductory commands.

2.  **Testing the Verifier Contract (`near call verifier.yourname.testnet verify_intent ...`)**:

    - **Critique**: The example call to `verify_intent` is shown.
    - **Inconsistency (Intent Structure)**: The `intent` object in the arguments (`action`, `input_token`, `input_amount`, `output_token`, `max_slippage`) is still the simplified version from `03-building-backend/01-local-contract.md`. It does _not_ match the expanded `Intent` struct defined in `03-building-backend/02-intent-verifier.md` (which added `id`, `user_account`, `min_output_amount`, `deadline`). This call will fail deserialization in the Verifier contract if the Verifier code is up-to-date with `02-intent-verifier.md`.
    - **Suggestion**: **Crucially, update the `intent` argument structure to match the latest Rust `Intent` struct definition.** For example:
      `'{"intent": {"id": "cli-intent-1", "user_account": "yourname.testnet", "action": "swap", "input_token": "USDC", "input_amount": 100, "output_token": "wNEAR", "min_output_amount": null, "max_slippage": 0.5, "deadline": null}}'`
    - Response expectation: "The response should include: A verification ID, A success/failure status, Any additional validation details." The current `verify_intent` returns `bool`. If a more complex response is expected, the Rust contract needs to be updated to return it.

3.  **Testing the Solver Contract (`near call solver.yourname.testnet solve_intent ...`)**:

    - **Critique**: The call to `solve_intent` passes `user` and `input_amount`.
    - **Inconsistency (Solver Method Signature)**: The `solve_intent` method in the Solver contract (`03-building-backend/03-solver-contract.md`) is defined as `pub fn solve_intent(&mut self, intent_id: String, user: AccountId, input_amount: Balance) -> ExecutionResult`. The CLI call is missing the `intent_id` argument. This call will fail.
    - **Suggestion**: **Update the CLI call to include `intent_id`**:
      `'{"intent_id": "cli-intent-1", "user": "yourname.testnet", "input_amount": 100}'`

4.  **Testing with Different Parameters**: Shows calls to `verify_intent` with invalid token and different slippage.

    - **Critique**: Good for showing how to test variations.
    - **Inconsistency (Intent Structure)**: These examples also use the outdated `Intent` structure and need to be updated as per point 2.

5.  **Testing Cross-Contract Calls (`near call verifier.yourname.testnet execute_with_solver ...`)**:

    - **Critique**: Calls a method `execute_with_solver` on the Verifier.
    - **Missing Method**: The Verifier contract, as defined up to `03-building-backend/02-intent-verifier.md`, has a `verify_and_solve` method, not `execute_with_solver`. The arguments `solver_id` and `intent_id` are also different from what `verify_and_solve` expects (it expects a full `Intent` object and `solver_account`).
    - **Suggestion**: Change the method name to `verify_and_solve` and adjust the arguments to match the Verifier's actual method signature:
      `near call verifier.yourname.testnet verify_and_solve '{"intent": { ...full intent object... }, "solver_account": "solver.yourname.testnet"}' --accountId yourname.testnet --gas 300000000000000`
      The full intent object needs to be provided here.

6.  **View Contract State**:

    - `near view-state ...`: Good.
    - `near view verifier.yourname.testnet get_intent '{"intent_id": "12345"}'`:
      - **Critique**: Assumes a `get_intent` method on the Verifier.
      - **Missing Method**: The Verifier contract currently only has `is_intent_verified(intent_id: String)`. It does not have a `get_intent` method that would return the full intent details.
      - **Suggestion**: Either add a `get_intent` method to the Verifier contract (if storing full intents or their status is desired for querying) or change this example to call an existing view method like `is_intent_verified`.

7.  **Working with Arguments (JSON file)**:
    - **Critique**: Shows using `echo ... > intent.json` and `near call ... "$(cat intent.json)"`. This is a very useful technique for complex arguments.
    - **Inconsistency (Intent Structure/Deadline)**: The `intent.json` example includes `"deadline": "1698523278000"` (a string). The Rust `Intent` struct defines `deadline: Option<u64>`. While NEAR CLI/SDK often handles string-to-number conversion for `u64`/`u128` if the string is a valid number, it's better to be precise. More importantly, this `intent` structure also needs to be updated to the latest version (include `id`, `user_account`, etc.).
    - **Suggestion**: Ensure the JSON structure in `intent.json` matches the latest Rust `Intent` struct. For the deadline, a numeric timestamp (as a JSON number, or as a string that is purely numeric) is expected for `u64` deserialization.

## How to Present Content Better for a Web2 Developer

1.  **CRITICAL: Ensure Argument Consistency**: The most significant issue throughout this section is the inconsistency between the arguments (especially the `Intent` structure) used in `near call` examples and the actual Rust struct definitions and method signatures in the contracts. This _must_ be fixed, or users will encounter constant errors.
2.  **Verify Method Existence**: Ensure all contract methods referenced in `near call` or `near view` examples (`execute_with_solver`, `get_intent`) actually exist in the corresponding Rust contracts as defined in the workshop. If they are new, their Rust implementation should be shown.
3.  **Expected Output**: For each `near call` example, briefly mention what kind of output or behavior the user should expect (e.g., "This should return `true`," or "This call might panic with an error message about X if the input is invalid," or "Check the transaction in NEAR Explorer to see logs.").
4.  **Gas Explanation**: Briefly explain why `--gas` is sometimes needed (for calls that do more work or make cross-contract calls) and that the default might not always be sufficient.
5.  **JSON Arguments**: When using JSON files for arguments, emphasize that the JSON structure must exactly match what the contract method expects for deserialization.

NEAR CLI is a fundamental tool. This section can be very effective if the examples are meticulously aligned with the evolving state of the smart contracts being built in the workshop. The current inconsistencies will likely lead to significant learner frustration.
