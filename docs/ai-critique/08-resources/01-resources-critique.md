# Critique for 08-resources/01-resources.md (Web2 dev perspective)

## Overall Impression

This section provides a list of resources for further learning. This is a standard and helpful part of any workshop. The categorization into Official Documentation, Tools & Projects, and Community & Support is good.

## What Doesn't Work / Needs Clarification

1.  **Link Formatting/Actual URLs**:

    - **Critique**: Many of the links in the tables are not actual URLs but descriptive text.
      - `docs.near.org/intents` - This looks like a plausible URL stub.
      - `github.com/near/intents` - Plausible.
      - `github.com/defuse-protocol/near-intents-amm-solver` - Plausible.
      - `Chain Signatures Documentation` - Not a URL.
      - `Meta Transactions Guide` - Not a URL.
      - `Deploy NEAR Multisig` - Not a URL.
      - `moremarkets.xyz` - Plausible.
      - `Bitte Wallet (Experimental)` - Not a URL, and the link text itself isn't clickable.
    - **Suggestion**: **Crucially, all resources listed should have actual, clickable URLs.** For documentation links, these should point directly to the relevant pages on `docs.near.org` or other official sources. For GitHub repos, direct links to the repos. For projects, links to their live sites or primary information pages.
      - For example, "Chain Signatures Documentation" should be something like `[Chain Signatures Documentation](https://docs.near.org/develop/contracts/chain-signatures)` (or the correct URL).
      - "Bitte Wallet (Experimental)" should have a link if it's a public project, e.g., `[Bitte Wallet (Experimental)](https://example.com/bittewallet)`.

2.  **Specificity of Links**:

    - **Critique**: Some links are general. For example, "NEAR Intents Overview" pointing to `docs.near.org/intents` is good if that page is a comprehensive overview. However, sometimes more specific links are better.
    - **Suggestion**: Where possible, link to the most relevant and specific page. For example, if there's a particular tutorial or deep-dive page for "Meta Transactions," link to that directly rather than a generic guide page if the guide is very broad.

3.  **Tools & Projects - Context**:

    - **Critique**: Listing tools like "NEAR Multisig Wallets" or projects like "MoreMarkets" is good. A little more context on _why_ they are relevant to intents or chain abstraction could be useful.
    - **Suggestion**: Add a brief (one-line) description for each tool/project explaining its relevance. E.g.:
      - `NEAR Multisig Wallets`: "(Useful for secure DAO/shared control over accounts that might originate or manage intents)."
      - `MoreMarkets (Live Project)`: "(Example of a live application leveraging some of these concepts)."
      - `Bitte Wallet (Experimental)`: "(Showcases experimental AI + Intent features)."

4.  **Community & Support**:

    - **Critique**: Listing the Developer Forum, Discord, and Workshops is good.
    - **Suggestion**: Provide direct links:
      - `NEAR Developer Forum`: `[NEAR Developer Forum](https://gov.near.org/c/development/6)` (or most relevant category).
      - `NEAR Discord`: `[NEAR Discord](https://near.chat)` (direct invite link).
      - `NEAR Workshops`: A link to a calendar or page listing upcoming workshops if available.

5.  **Implementation Examples**:
    - **Critique**: States that resources above include reference implementations and encourages experimentation.
    - **Suggestion**: This is a good concluding thought for the resources section.

## How to Present Content Better for a Web2 Developer

1.  **ACTIONABLE LINKS**: This is the most important. Every resource listed must be a functioning hyperlink to the correct destination. Text placeholders are not helpful.
2.  **Curate for Relevance**: Ensure that the linked resources are indeed the best starting points for someone who has just completed this workshop. Are they up-to-date? Are they suitable for the next step in learning?
3.  **Brief Descriptions**: For tools, projects, or even some documentation links, a short explanatory sentence on _why this resource is particularly relevant_ to intents, smart wallets, or chain abstraction can save the developer time in figuring out if it's what they need.
4.  **Difficulty/Next Step Indication (Optional)**: For some resources, especially if they are very advanced, a small note like "(Advanced Topic)" or "(Deep Dive)" can help learners navigate.

A resources section is only as good as its links and the clarity of what those links offer. Prioritizing correct and direct URLs is key, followed by brief context for each resource.
