# Critique for 03-building-backend/07-gas-fees.md (Web2 dev perspective)

## Overall Impression

This "Bonus" section on Gas & Fees is highly relevant and important. For Web2 developers, the concept of directly paying for computation/storage (gas) for every operation is new, as is the multi-layered fee structure in an intent system (gas, solver, protocol, DEX fees). This section provides a good overview of these economic aspects and optimization techniques.

## What Doesn't Work / Needs Clarification

1.  **Understanding the Economics (Numbered List of Fees)**:

    - **Critique**: The four types of fees are well-identified.
    - **Suggestion**: Briefly explain who pays and who receives each fee, and at what stage they are typically incurred. For instance:
      - `Gas Fees`: "Paid by the transaction initiator (user, or relayer in meta-transactions) to the NEAR network validators for processing and storing the transaction."
      - `Solver Fees`: "Paid by the user (often deducted from their input amount or output amount) to the specific Solver that successfully executes their intent."
      - `Protocol Fees`: "Optional fees that could be built into the intent system itself (e.g., by the Verifier or a central coordinating contract) and might go towards maintaining the protocol or a DAO treasury."
      - `DEX/Protocol Fees`: "Fees inherent to the underlying protocols the Solver interacts with (e.g., a 0.3% swap fee on a particular DEX). These are part of the execution cost the Solver incurs and factors into their overall execution strategy."

2.  **Gas Optimization Techniques (Rust examples)**:

    - **Critique**: The examples (using `LookupMap` instead of `Vec` for `verified_intents`, using `BorshDeserialize`/`BorshSerialize` for `IntentStatus`, batching operations) are practical.
    - **Suggestion**:
      - For `LookupMap<String, IntentStatus>`: Explain _why_ it's more gas-efficient for this use case than `Vec`: "`LookupMap` provides more efficient (O(log n) for reads/writes on average if entry names are hashed, or O(1) if key is simple and short enough) access and modification of individual entries compared to iterating through a `Vec`, especially as the number of intents grows. It also generally consumes less gas for point lookups, writes, and removals than a `Vec` which might require re-allocations or shifting elements."
      - `#[derive(BorshDeserialize, BorshSerialize)] pub struct IntentStatus`: Explain Borsh: "Borsh is a binary serialization format designed by NEAR for efficient and secure data storage and transmission in smart contracts. It's generally more gas-efficient than JSON for on-chain storage."
      - `verify_multiple_intents`: Good example of batching. Note that the gas cost for such a call would be higher due to processing multiple intents, but the _per-intent_ overhead (like transaction fixed costs) might be lower if batched effectively by a user or relayer.

3.  **Fee Models for Solvers (Enum `FeeModel` and `calculate_fee` logic)**:

    - **Critique**: The different fee models are well-explained, and the Rust `enum` and `impl` block provide a clear way to implement this logic.
    - **Suggestion**: This is a strong part of the section. A Web2 dev can relate this to different SaaS pricing models.

4.  **Incentive Alignment (Numbered List)**:

    - **Critique**: Good points for a healthy ecosystem.
    - **Suggestion**: For "Reputation Systems," briefly mention how this might work (e.g., "Solvers could be rated based on success rate, execution speed, price accuracy, and this reputation could influence their selection or the trust users place in them.").

5.  **MEV Protection (Numbered List)**:

    - **Critique**: Important considerations. "Private Intents" and "Batch Execution" are key strategies.
    - **Suggestion**: For "Private Intents": Briefly explain what this means in practice (e.g., "Intents might be submitted to a trusted channel or encrypted before being revealed only to selected solvers or at the point of execution, rather than being broadcast publicly on a mempool where they can be front-run.").

6.  **Cost Comparison (Table)**:

    - **Critique**: The table comparing Direct Smart Contract, Basic Intent System, and Advanced Intent System across Gas Costs, UX, and Complexity is a very useful heuristic.
    - **Suggestion**: This is a great summary. Consider adding a fourth row or a note about "Solver/Protocol Fees" as another cost dimension, which would likely be Low/None for Direct, and potentially Medium to High for Intent Systems, offsetting some gas savings for the user perhaps.

7.  **Optimizing User Costs (Numbered List)**:
    - **Critique**: Good, user-centric optimization strategies. Batching, off-chain verification, gasless transactions, and session keys are all impactful.
    - **Suggestion**: For "Offchain Verification": Briefly explain what aspects could be verified off-chain to save gas (e.g., "Checking user signatures, basic intent formatting, or even simulating against current market prices before submitting to the on-chain Verifier contract.").

## How to Present Content Better for a Web2 Developer

- **Relate Gas to Cloud Costs**: Explain gas as paying for resources (CPU, storage, bandwidth) on a decentralized public computer (the blockchain), somewhat analogous to how cloud services charge for resource consumption, but often more granular and directly tied to each operation.
- **Clarify Who Pays What**: Be very clear about the flow of fees â€“ who initiates the payment, who receives it, and for what service, for each fee type.
- **Explain Borsh**: Since it's mentioned for gas efficiency, briefly explain what Borsh is and why it's preferred over, say, JSON for on-chain storage in NEAR.
- **Benefits vs. Costs of Abstraction**: The table is good for this. Emphasize that while intent systems add layers (and potentially their own fees), the goal is often to reduce _net user cost_ (including time, effort, risk, and direct monetary cost from bad execution) and improve UX, even if raw gas on one part of the system is higher than a direct, unassisted call.
- **MEV for Web2 Devs**: Explain MEV in terms a Web2 dev might understand, e.g., like high-frequency trading advantages or a malicious actor trying to exploit information leakage in a transactional system.

This bonus section is very valuable. Understanding the economics and gas/fee implications is crucial for designing sustainable and user-friendly Web3 applications. The content is strong; the suggestions are mostly for adding a bit more explanatory depth for those new to these specific blockchain economic concepts.
