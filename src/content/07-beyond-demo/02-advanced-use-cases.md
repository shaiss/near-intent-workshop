# 7.2: Advanced Use Cases for Intent Architecture

**Time**: 30 minutes  
**Pre-requisite**: Understanding of composability from 7.1

## Extending Your Workshop Implementation to Real-World Scenarios

The basic intent architecture we've built in this workshop demonstrates core concepts, but production applications often require more sophisticated capabilities. In this section, we'll explore how our workshop implementation could be extended to support real-world use cases.

> ðŸ’¡ **Extension Note**: The use cases in this section would require additional components and infrastructure beyond what we've built in the workshop. We'll clearly indicate what extensions would be needed for each scenario.

## Use Case 1: Unified DeFi Access

### The Problem

In traditional DeFi, users must manually choose which DEX to use and navigate different interfaces. This creates friction and often results in suboptimal trades.

> ðŸ’¡ **Web2 Parallel**: This is similar to how travel aggregators like Kayak or Expedia compare flights across multiple airlines, letting users simply specify their destination and dates without choosing a specific airline.

### Extended Intent Structure

Building on our workshop implementation, we would extend the Intent structure to support additional parameters for DeFi swaps:

```javascript
{
  "id": "defi-intent-123",
  "user_account": "alice.near",
  "action": "swap",
  "input_token": "USDC",
  "input_amount": "10000000000", // 10 USDC with 6 decimals
  "output_token": "wNEAR",
  "min_output_amount": null,
  "max_slippage": 0.5,
  // Extensions for DeFi-specific parameters
  "routing_preference": "best_price", // Options: best_price, lowest_gas, fastest
  "max_gas_usage": "100000000000000", // Maximum gas to spend
  "execution_deadline": 1692381924
}
```

### Implementation Requirements

To support this use case, you would need to extend your workshop implementation with:

1. **On-chain extensions**:

   - Enhanced Verifier contract that understands the additional parameters
   - Specialized DeFi Solver contracts that connect to various DEXes

2. **Off-chain components**:
   - Price discovery service to find the best routes across DEXes
   - Gas estimation service to calculate expected costs

### Code Example: DeFi Solver Extensions

```rust
// Extension to workshop's Solver contract for DeFi routing
impl DeFiSolver {
    // Find the best execution route across multiple DEXes
    pub fn find_optimal_route(&self, intent: &Intent) -> Option<ExecutionRoute> {
        let routes = self.get_possible_routes(
            intent.input_token.clone(),
            intent.output_token.clone(),
            intent.input_amount
        );

        // Sort routes based on user preference
        match intent.routing_preference.as_str() {
            "best_price" => self.sort_by_output_amount(routes),
            "lowest_gas" => self.sort_by_gas_usage(routes),
            "fastest" => self.sort_by_execution_time(routes),
            _ => self.sort_by_output_amount(routes) // Default to best price
        }
        .first()
        .cloned()
    }

    // Execute the optimal route
    pub fn execute_swap(&mut self, intent: Intent) -> Promise {
        let route = self.find_optimal_route(&intent)
            .expect("No valid route found");

        // Log the selected route
        env::log_str(&format!("Executing via route: {:?}", route));

        // Execute the route
        match route.dex.as_str() {
            "ref_finance" => self.execute_on_ref_finance(route, intent),
            "jumbo" => self.execute_on_jumbo(route, intent),
            _ => env::panic_str("Unsupported DEX")
        }
    }
}
```

## Use Case 2: Cross-Chain Token Swaps

### The Problem

Blockchain ecosystems exist in silos - assets on one chain can't easily be used on another without complex bridging processes that often require multiple steps and wallet approvals.

> ðŸ’¡ **Web2 Parallel**: This is like offering a unified checkout experience across multiple e-commerce sites where users don't need to create separate accounts or enter payment details on each site.

### Extended Intent Structure

This use case would require a specialized intent structure that extends our base implementation to include cross-chain parameters:

```javascript
{
  "id": "cross-chain-intent-456",
  "user_account": "alice.near",
  "action": "cross_chain_swap",
  // Source chain details
  "source_chain": "near",
  "input_token": "USDC",
  "input_amount": "10000000000", // 10 USDC
  // Destination chain details
  "destination_chain": "ethereum",
  "output_token": "ETH",
  "min_output_amount": "500000000000000000", // 0.5 ETH
  "max_slippage": 1.0,
  // Security parameters
  "timeout_seconds": 1800, // 30 minutes
  "fallback_action": "refund" // What to do if the swap fails
}
```

### Implementation Requirements

This advanced use case would require substantial extensions:

1. **On-chain components**:

   - Cross-chain aware Verifier contract
   - Bridge-integrated Solver contracts
   - Chain-specific adapters for each supported blockchain

2. **Off-chain infrastructure**:
   - Relayer network to monitor and execute cross-chain transactions
   - Bridge monitoring service for transaction verification
   - Security fallback mechanisms

### Technology Spotlight: Chain Signatures

To enable cross-chain operations, you'd need Chain Signatures, a NEAR protocol feature that lets users sign messages that can be verified on other blockchains.

```javascript
// Front-end code using Chain Signatures (not part of workshop implementation)
async function createCrossChainIntent(userAccount, sourceParams, destParams) {
  // Initialize Chain Signatures client
  const chainSignatures = new ChainSignatures({
    network: "mainnet",
    wallet: connectedWallet,
  });

  // Create the intent
  const intent = {
    id: generateUniqueId(),
    user_account: userAccount,
    action: "cross_chain_swap",
    source_chain: sourceParams.chain,
    input_token: sourceParams.token,
    input_amount: sourceParams.amount,
    destination_chain: destParams.chain,
    output_token: destParams.token,
    min_output_amount: destParams.minAmount,
    max_slippage: 1.0,
    timeout_seconds: 1800,
    fallback_action: "refund",
  };

  // Sign the intent for cross-chain verification
  const signedIntent = await chainSignatures.signIntent(intent);

  return signedIntent;
}
```

## Use Case 3: Enhanced Wallet Experience with Session Keys

### The Problem

Regular blockchain transactions require wallet confirmation for every action, creating friction in user experience. Session keys can dramatically improve this.

> ðŸ’¡ **Web2 Parallel**: This is similar to how apps use OAuth refresh tokens or "Keep me logged in" functionality to avoid requiring password re-entry for every operation.

### How This Extends Our Workshop Implementation

Module 4 of our workshop already introduced session keys. Here's how we can extend that foundation to support more advanced patterns:

```javascript
// Enhanced session key configuration (extends Module 4 implementation)
const sessionKeyConfig = {
  // Basic configuration from our workshop
  publicKey: "ed25519:AbCdEf123456...",
  allowance: "250000000000000000000000", // 0.25 NEAR

  // Extended permissions for multiple contracts
  receiverId: ["verifier.near", "defi.near", "nft.near"],

  // Fine-grained method controls
  methodNames: {
    "verifier.near": ["verify_intent", "verify_and_solve"],
    "defi.near": ["swap", "deposit", "withdraw"],
    "nft.near": ["transfer", "mint"],
  },

  // Transaction limits
  maxTransactionsPerDay: 20,

  // Time-based expiration
  expirationTimestamp: 1692381924,
};
```

### Implementation Requirements

1. **On-chain extensions**:

   - Enhanced smart wallet contract with support for complex permission patterns
   - Integration with authentication providers

2. **Off-chain components**:
   - Session management service
   - Transaction simulation for security checks

### Code Example: Meta-Transactions for Gasless UX

Building on session keys, meta-transactions allow users to perform actions without having NEAR tokens for gas - a relay pays for gas on their behalf:

```javascript
// Client-side code for creating a meta-transaction
async function createMetaTransaction(userAccount, action) {
  // 1. User signs the transaction data but doesn't submit it
  const transaction = {
    signerId: userAccount,
    receiverId: "verifier.near",
    actions: [
      {
        type: "FunctionCall",
        params: {
          methodName: "verify_intent",
          args: {
            intent: {
              id: "meta-tx-intent-789",
              user_account: userAccount,
              action: "swap",
              // Other intent parameters...
            },
          },
          gas: "300000000000000",
          deposit: "0",
        },
      },
    ],
  };

  // User signs the transaction data
  const signedData = await wallet.signMessage({
    message: JSON.stringify(transaction),
    recipient: "relay.near",
  });

  // 2. Send the signed data to a relayer service
  const response = await fetch("https://relay.near.org/submit", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({
      signedTransaction: signedData,
      userAccount: userAccount,
    }),
  });

  // 3. Relayer executes the transaction, paying gas
  return await response.json();
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ **Implementation Note**: True meta-transactions require a specialized relayer service and contract modifications to verify the user's signature within the contract.

## Use Case 4: DAO and Multisig Integration

### The Problem

Traditional DAO operations often require complex governance processes for financial decisions. Intent-based architecture can streamline this flow.

> ðŸ’¡ **Web2 Parallel**: This is similar to how enterprise systems use approval workflows where transactions require multiple authorizations based on predefined rules.

### Extended Intent Structure

This use case leverages the composability we discussed in 7.1, with additional DAO-specific parameters:

```javascript
{
  "id": "dao-intent-101112",
  "user_account": "dao.near", // The DAO account is the sender
  "action": "compose",
  "compose_type": "sequential",
  "steps": [
    {
      "action": "swap",
      "input_token": "USDC",
      "input_amount": "1000000000000", // 1M USDC
      "output_token": "ETH",
      "min_output_amount": null,
      "max_slippage": 0.5
    },
    {
      "action": "bridge",
      "input_token": "ETH",
      "input_amount": "$PREVIOUS_OUTPUT",
      "destination_chain": "ethereum",
      "recipient": "dao-treasury.eth"
    }
  ],
  // DAO-specific parameters
  "approval_threshold": 3, // Number of approvals needed
  "approved_by": ["council-1.near", "council-2.near"], // Current approvals
  "execution_window_start": 1692381924,
  "execution_window_end": 1692468324
}
```

### Implementation Requirements

1. **On-chain extensions**:

   - Multisig contract with intent execution capabilities
   - DAO governance contract integration
   - Threshold signature schemes

2. **Off-chain components**:
   - Approval collection and verification system
   - Execution monitoring and reporting tools

### Code Example: DAO Integration

```rust
// Rust contract code for DAO intent execution
#[near_bindgen]
impl DAOContract {
    pub fn propose_intent(&mut self, intent: Intent) -> ProposalId {
        // Verify the caller is a DAO member
        self.assert_is_member(env::predecessor_account_id());

        // Create a proposal with the intent
        let proposal_id = self.next_proposal_id;
        self.next_proposal_id += 1;

        let proposal = Proposal {
            id: proposal_id,
            proposer: env::predecessor_account_id(),
            intent: intent,
            votes_for: vec![env::predecessor_account_id()], // Proposer automatically votes yes
            votes_against: vec![],
            status: ProposalStatus::Active,
            created_at: env::block_timestamp(),
        };

        self.proposals.insert(&proposal_id, &proposal);

        proposal_id
    }

    pub fn vote(&mut self, proposal_id: ProposalId, vote: Vote) {
        // Implementation of voting logic
        // ...
    }

    pub fn execute_proposal(&mut self, proposal_id: ProposalId) -> Promise {
        let proposal = self.proposals.get(&proposal_id).expect("Proposal not found");

        // Verify proposal passed and is ready for execution
        assert_eq!(proposal.status, ProposalStatus::Approved, "Proposal not approved");

        // Execute the intent using the Verifier contract
        ext_verifier::verify_and_solve(
            proposal.intent.clone(),
            self.solver_account_id.clone(),
            &self.verifier_account_id,
            0, // No deposit
            Gas(100 * TGAS)
        )
    }
}
```

## Getting Started with Advanced Use Cases

While the full implementation of these use cases goes beyond our workshop, you can begin exploring them by:

1. **Start small**: Pick one extension (e.g., adding routing_preference to your Intent structure)
2. **Modify your Verifier**: Update it to accept and validate the extended parameters
3. **Build a specialized Solver**: Create a solver that demonstrates the new capability
4. **Test incrementally**: Begin with simple extensions before moving to complex cross-chain scenarios
