# Critique for 06-testnet-deployment/03-debug-intents.md (Web2 dev perspective)

## Overall Impression

This section focuses on debugging strategies for intent contracts, primarily using `env::log_str` in Rust and then viewing these logs via NEAR Explorer or NEAR CLI. It also covers common issues like gas, permissions, and malformed arguments, and briefly touches on debugging cross-contract calls. For a Web2 developer, logging is a familiar debugging technique, so this section provides a good entry point into how it's done in the NEAR smart contract environment.

## What Doesn't Work / Needs Clarification

1.  **Adding Debug Logs (`env::log_str`)**:

    - **Critique**: Good introduction to the primary logging tool.
    - **Suggestion**: Mention the approximate gas cost of logging, as excessive logging can impact transaction fees. "`env::log_str` is very useful for debugging, but be mindful that each log consumes gas. For production contracts, you might want to make logging conditional or less verbose to save on gas costs."

2.  **Common Debug Patterns (Log entry/exit, decision points, state changes)**:

    - **Critique**: These are excellent, standard logging practices that translate well from any backend development.
    - **Suggestion**: The Rust examples are clear. Perhaps for "Log State Changes," mention that for complex state, logging the entire state might be too verbose or costly, so logging specific changed fields or a summary is often better.

3.  **Viewing Logs (NEAR Explorer, NEAR CLI)**:

    - **Critique**: Clear instructions on where to find the logs.
    - **Suggestion**: For NEAR Explorer, a screenshot showing where the "Logs" section is typically found in a transaction view could be helpful for visual learners.

4.  **Common Intent Debug Issues**:

    - **Missing Gas**: Good explanation and shows how to increase gas with `--gas`.
    - **Permission Issues**: Suggests `near keys` (good) and `near view verifier.yourname.testnet get_allowed_signers '{}'`.
      - **Critique**: The `get_allowed_signers` method is not a standard NEAR SDK method and hasn't been defined in the Verifier contract examples so far.
      - **Suggestion**: If this method is specific to the workshop's Verifier design for managing permissions, its Rust implementation should be shown. Otherwise, for general permission issues (e.g., a key not having FunctionCall access for a specific method), the error message from the transaction failure itself is usually the primary indicator.
    - **Malformed Arguments**: Suggests `echo '...' | jq` for JSON validation (good) and an example `near call`.
      - **Inconsistency (Intent Structure)**: The `near call verifier.yourname.testnet verify_intent '{"intent": {"action": "swap", "input_token": "USDC"}}' ...` example still uses an incomplete/outdated `Intent` structure. This should be updated to the latest full `Intent` definition used in the Verifier contract to avoid reinforcing incorrect argument formats.

5.  **Debugging Cross-Contract Calls**:
    - **Critique**: Suggests logging before/after promise creation (good). Mentions `promise_result` (important for callbacks) and shows a `promise.then(...)` structure for handling callbacks.
    - **Suggestion**:
      - `promise_result`: Briefly explain what `promise_result(index)` does within a callback method (i.e., retrieves the outcome of the promise at the given index).
      - The example `external_contract.ext(env::current_account_id()).with_static_gas(Gas(5 * TGAS)).external_function_call();` is a bit generic. It might be more helpful to relate it to the Verifier calling the Solver, e.g.:
        `ext_solver::ext(solver_account_id).with_static_gas(Gas(5 * TGAS)).solve_intent(intent_id, user_account, input_amount);`
      - The callback example `Self::ext(env::current_account_id()).with_static_gas(Gas(5 * TGAS)).handle_callback()` is good. Emphasize that `handle_callback` is a method _on the calling contract_ (e.g., the Verifier) that will be invoked after the external call (`solve_intent`) completes.

## How to Present Content Better for a Web2 Developer

1.  **Consistency in Examples**: Ensure all `near call` examples, especially those demonstrating argument structures, use the latest and correct `Intent` struct definition from the Rust contracts. This is a recurring issue.
2.  **Verify Custom Methods**: If suggesting CLI commands that call custom view methods on contracts (like `get_allowed_signers` or `get_intent`), ensure these methods are actually part of the workshop's contract code and their implementation has been shown.
3.  **Practical Callback Example**: For debugging cross-contract calls, a more concrete (even if still simplified) callback example related to the Verifier-Solver interaction would be more illustrative than a generic one. Show how the Verifier's callback method would check `env::promise_result(0)` to see if the Solver's `solve_intent` succeeded or failed.
4.  **Relate to Web2 Debugging**: Draw parallels to familiar debugging tools and techniques: logs are like server logs, NEAR Explorer is like a request/response inspector or distributed tracing UI (at a high level), and CLI calls are like using `curl` or Postman.
5.  **Local Testing/Simulation for Debugging**: Briefly mention that local testing environments (like `near-sdk-sim` or unit tests with `VMContextBuilder`) are often the first line of defense for debugging logic before deploying to testnet, as they offer faster iteration and potentially more detailed inspection capabilities (though not direct debugger stepping in Rust contract code execution itself).

Debugging is a universal developer skill. This section provides a good NEAR-specific starting point. Addressing the inconsistencies and making the cross-contract call debugging example more concrete will significantly improve its effectiveness.
