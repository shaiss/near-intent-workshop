# Critique for 03-building-backend/05-deploy-to-testnet.md (Web2 dev perspective)

## Overall Impression

This section is a short, practical guide to deploying the Verifier and Solver contracts to the testnet. It reuses the `near deploy` command, which is good for reinforcement. For a Web2 developer, this is analogous to deploying backend services to a staging or development server.

## What Doesn't Work / Needs Clarification

1.  **Pre-requisite: "Use an existing testnet account"**

    - **Critique**: This refers back to the initial setup.
    - **Suggestion**: It might be helpful to remind the user that `yourname.testnet` in the commands should be replaced with their actual testnet account ID. Also, `solver.yourname.testnet` implies they should create a sub-account or a separate account for the solver. This should be clarified.
      - "Ensure you have your NEAR testnet account ready (e.g., `yourname.testnet` from Module 1). For the Solver, you can deploy it to a sub-account like `solver.yourname.testnet` (created via `near create-account solver.yourname.testnet --masterAccount yourname.testnet`) or a completely separate testnet account if you have one."

2.  **ðŸš€ Upload Verifier / ðŸ§© Upload Solver (`near deploy ...`)**

    - **Critique**: The commands are clear. They deploy the `.wasm` files built in previous sections.
    - **Suggestion**:
      - **Missing Initialization**: Crucially, these `near deploy` commands are missing the `--initFunction` and `--initArgs` that were shown and explained in the `03-solver-contract.md` section for the Solver, and are also necessary for the Verifier (to set `owner_id`). Without initialization, the contracts might not function correctly or securely (e.g., `owner_id` would be a default/empty value).
        - **This is a significant omission.** The deployment commands should be consistent with how the contracts were designed, including their `new` (initialization) methods.
        - Example for Verifier: `near deploy --accountId verifier.yourname.testnet --wasmFile ./verifier/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/verifier.wasm --initFunction new --initArgs '{"owner_id": "yourname.testnet"}'`
        - Example for Solver (as shown before): `near deploy --accountId solver.yourname.testnet --wasmFile ./solver/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/solver.wasm --initFunction new --initArgs '{"owner_id": "yourname.testnet", "execution_fee": 20}'` (assuming `yourname.testnet` owns both for simplicity here, or a dedicated admin account).
      - Path to WASM files: The paths `./verifier/target/...` and `./solver/target/...` assume the commands are run from the `contracts` directory (or one level above, like the project root, if `verifier` and `solver` are subdirectories of `contracts`). Clarify the expected current working directory for these commands or use paths relative to the project root if that's more consistent.

3.  **ðŸ§ª Test Call (`near call yourname.testnet verify_intent ...`)**
    - **Critique**: This calls `verify_intent` on the _Verifier_ contract (assuming `yourname.testnet` is where the Verifier was deployed, which is confusing if it's also the user's main account ID). The arguments match the simplified `Intent` struct from `01-local-contract.md`, not the expanded `Intent` struct from `02-intent-verifier.md` (which added `id`, `user_account`, `min_output_amount`, `deadline`).
    - **Suggestion**:
      - **Target Account for Call**: The call should target the Verifier's deployed account ID, e.g., `verifier.yourname.testnet` if that was the deployment target.
      - **Argument Mismatch**: The `verify_intent` call example is using an outdated `Intent` structure. It should match the structure defined in `02-intent-verifier.md` which includes fields like `id` and `user_account`. This will lead to a deserialization error if not corrected.
        - Corrected call example (conceptual, assuming Verifier at `verifier.yourname.testnet`):
          `near call verifier.yourname.testnet verify_intent '{"intent":{"id":"test-deploy-1", "user_account":"yourname.testnet", "action":"swap","input_token":"USDC","input_amount":100,"output_token":"wNEAR", "min_output_amount": null, "max_slippage":0.5, "deadline": null}}' --accountId yourname.testnet`
      - What about `verify_and_solve`? Since the previous section focused on connecting the two, a test call to `verify_and_solve` would be a more comprehensive test for this stage, ensuring the cross-contract call setup is also tested.

## How to Present Content Better for a Web2 Developer

- **Consistency is Key**: Ensure that deployment commands (`--initFunction`, `--initArgs`) and test call arguments (`Intent` struct) are consistent with the contract code developed in the preceding sections. Discrepancies here will lead to significant user frustration.
- **Clarify Account IDs**: Be very explicit about which account ID is being used for what purpose (user's personal account, Verifier contract account, Solver contract account) in the `near deploy` and `near call` commands.
- **Explain Sub-accounts (if used)**: If suggesting `solver.yourname.testnet`, briefly explain how to create such a sub-account.
- **Expected Output/Verification**: After the `near call`, what should the user look for to confirm success? (e.g., "The call should return `true`, and you can check NEAR Explorer for logs from the `verify_intent` method.")
- **Directory Context for Commands**: Specify the directory from which `near deploy` commands should be run to ensure the WASM file paths are correct.

This section, while short, is critical. Deployment is where the code meets the (test) network. Errors or inconsistencies in deployment instructions or test calls can be a major roadblock for learners. The most urgent fixes are to include the initialization arguments in the `near deploy` commands and to correct the `Intent` structure in the `near call` example.
