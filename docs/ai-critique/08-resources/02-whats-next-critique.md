# Critique for 08-resources/02-whats-next.md (Web2 dev perspective)

## Overall Impression

This section provides prompts for further exploration, project ideas, and suggestions for community engagement. It aims to guide the learner on how to apply their new knowledge. This is a good way to encourage continued learning and participation.

## What Doesn't Work / Needs Clarification

1.  **Exploration Prompts**:

    - **Critique**: The questions are thought-provoking and relevant to internalizing the workshop content.
    - **Suggestion**: These are good as is. They encourage reflection.

2.  **Project Ideas**:

    - **Critique**: The four categories (Build a Custom Solver, Improve an Existing Project, Create a Smart Wallet Integration, Design Cross-Chain Experiences) are excellent and provide concrete avenues for further work. The sub-points are good examples.
    - **Suggestion**:
      - For "Improve an Existing Project - Clone one of the public Intents DEXs and add a UI feature": It would be helpful to link to one or two of the example public Intents DEXs mentioned in earlier sections (e.g., from `07-beyond-demo/02-advanced-use-cases.md` like Turbo Swap or MoreMarkets) if their code is open source and suitable for cloning/contribution.
      - For "Build a smart wallet that uses meta-tx + session keys": This is a good advanced project. Ensure the workshop has provided enough foundational knowledge on meta-transactions (the relayer aspect) if this is a primary suggestion.

3.  **Community Engagement**:
    - **Critique**: Suggestions to join the forum, contribute to open source, provide feedback, and participate in hackathons are all excellent ways to get more involved.
    - **Suggestion**:
      - **Direct Links**: Similar to the `01-resources.md` file, provide direct links:
        - `NEAR Developer Forum`: `[NEAR Developer Forum](https://gov.near.org/c/development/6)` (or most relevant link).
        - "open-source intents projects": If there are specific GitHub organizations or key repositories (like `github.com/near/intents` mentioned earlier), link them here as starting points for finding projects to contribute to.
        - "intents specification": If there's a formal specification document or a place where feedback on it is gathered, link to it.
        - "community hackathons": Link to a page or resource where NEAR hackathons are typically announced (e.g., a specific page on near.org, or a community like DoraHacks if relevant).

## How to Present Content Better for a Web2 Developer

1.  **Make Project Ideas More Concrete (with Links)**: For project ideas that involve existing projects (like cloning a DEX), providing direct links to those projects' repositories would make it much easier for a developer to get started.
2.  **Actionable Community Links**: Ensure all community engagement suggestions have direct, up-to-date URLs.
3.  **Skill Mapping (Optional)**: For a Web2 developer, it might be helpful to briefly map the project ideas to skills they might want to develop or leverage:
    - E.g., "Build a Custom Solver" - good for deepening backend/Rust skills and understanding DeFi protocol integration.
    - "Improve an Existing Project (UI feature)" - good for leveraging frontend skills (React, etc.) in a Web3 context.
    - "Create a Smart Wallet Integration" - good for focusing on UX, security, and client-side Web3 integration.
4.  **Encourage Sharing**: Reiterate that sharing their projects or learnings in the community forum is a great way to get feedback and connect with others.

This section serves as a good motivational outro, encouraging learners to take the next steps. Making the suggestions as actionable as possible with direct links will greatly enhance its utility.
