# Critique for 02-understanding-building-blocks/01-intents-concept.md (Web2 dev perspective)

## Overall Impression

This section effectively defines intents and contrasts them with traditional imperative transactions. The examples are helpful. For a Web2 developer, the core idea of declarative expressions vs. imperative steps is familiar (e.g., SQL vs. procedural code, or high-level API calls vs. manual step-by-step operations).

## What Doesn't Work / Needs Clarification

1.  **"Chain-agnostic": Can be resolved on multiple chains**

    - **Critique**: This was mentioned in the overview. Here, it could be expanded slightly with an example of _why_ this is powerful, especially in the context of a specific intent.
    - **Suggestion**: "For instance, a 'swap X for Y' intent could potentially be fulfilled by finding the best liquidity pool for that pair across several connected blockchains, or even by routing through multiple chains, without the user needing to know these details."

2.  **"Composable": Can be embedded inside apps, widgets, or bots**

    - **Critique**: "Composable" is a powerful concept in Web3. For a Web2 dev, this might translate to reusable components or microservices. The examples (apps, widgets, bots) are good.
    - **Suggestion**: Perhaps add a sentence on _why_ this composability is particularly beneficial in the intent architecture. "This means developers can easily build complex financial or operational workflows by combining existing intents, much like assembling a pipeline from pre-built software components."

3.  **Declarative Over Imperative - Traditional blockchain transactions are imperative**: "Users specify exact contract calls, Parameters are fixed at submission time, Execution flow is predetermined."

    - **Critique**: This is a good summary. For a Web2 dev, this is the part that might sound most like current complex API integrations they might be used to.
    - **Suggestion**: To drive the point home, you could add a small, _conceptual_ (not code) example of an imperative transaction: "e.g., To swap tokens imperatively, a user might have to: 1. Approve token X for spending by DEX A. 2. Call swap function on DEX A with exact parameters. 3. If it fails, try DEX B, repeating approval and swap calls."

4.  **Examples of Intents (JSON)**:

    - **Critique**: The JSON examples are excellent and clear for developers. The progression from simple transfer to token swap to cross-chain bridge is logical.
    - **Suggestion**: Minor point: in the "Token Swap Intent," the output token is `wNEAR`. A Web2 dev might wonder what `wNEAR` is versus `NEAR` (mentioned in the simple transfer). A quick footnote or a brief parenthetical note like `(wrapped NEAR, a tokenized version of NEAR often used in DeFi)` could be helpful if `wNEAR` hasn't been defined elsewhere.

5.  **Benefits of Intent Architecture**: These are well-listed and mostly clear.

    - **Market Efficiency - "Competitive solver marketplace"**: Reinforce _how_ this leads to better prices/lower fees. "Solvers compete, often bidding to fulfill the intent, driving down costs for the user."
    - **Risk Reduction - "Failed transaction protection"**: This is a significant benefit. How is this achieved? Is it that the intent isn't executed if constraints can't be met, or is there a retry mechanism? "Intents can be designed so that if a solver cannot guarantee successful execution within the user's constraints (e.g., maximum slippage), the transaction might not proceed, saving the user from failed transaction fees and unpredictable outcomes common in imperative systems."

6.  **Intent Lifecycle**: This is a clear, step-by-step breakdown.
    - **Creation - "Basic validation"**: What kind of basic validation happens on the frontend? (e.g., input format, sufficient balance check if possible?)
    - **Solver Selection - "Best path selected"**: How is "best" determined? Is it configurable by the user or application (e.g., fastest, cheapest)? "The system, or sometimes the user via preferences, selects the 'best' path based on criteria like price, speed, or reliability offered by competing solvers."
    - **Execution - "Results verified"**: Verified by whom/what? The Verifier again, or the Smart Wallet? "The outcome of the execution is then checked (often by the Verifier or the Smart Wallet system) to ensure it matches the original intent before finalizing."

## How to Present Content Better for a Web2 Developer

- **Lean on Analogies**: Continue using analogies to Web2 concepts where appropriate (e.g., declarative SQL, microservices for composability, competitive bidding for solvers).
- **Explain Web3 Specifics Clearly**: When Web3-specific terms or patterns are used (like `wNEAR`, or the competitive nature of solvers), provide brief, accessible explanations.
- **Focus on Problem/Solution**: For benefits like "Risk Reduction," clearly articulate the problem in traditional systems (e.g., users paying for failed transactions) and how intents solve it.
- **Elaborate on Lifecycle Steps**: Add a bit more detail to each step in the lifecycle to clarify who does what and why, especially regarding validation and selection criteria.

This section is already quite good. The suggestions are mostly about adding a bit more explanatory depth for someone less familiar with the nuances of blockchain interactions and the specific problems that intent-based architectures aim to solve.
