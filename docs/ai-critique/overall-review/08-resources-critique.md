# Critique for Section: 08-resources

This final section provides resources, project ideas, and a wrap-up summary. It contains minimal code, mostly conceptual snippets illustrating potential extensions.

## File-Specific Issues:

### `01-resources.md`

1.  **Link Validity and Relevance**:
    - **Issue**: The file contains numerous external links to documentation, examples, and community resources.
    - **Expected**: Periodically verify that all external links are still active and point to the most relevant and up-to-date content. Broken links or links to outdated documentation reduce the section's value.
2.  **Difficulty Rating Consistency**:
    - **Issue**: Resources are assigned difficulty ratings (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
    - **Expected**: Review the assigned difficulties for reasonable consistency, acknowledging that this is subjective but should provide helpful guidance to learners.

### `02-whats-next.md`

1.  **Assumptions in Conceptual Code (Rust - Staking Intent)**:
    - **Issue**: The `validate_stake_intent` Rust example checks `self.valid_validators.contains(validator)`. The `valid_validators` field is not part of the Verifier contract developed earlier.
    - **Expected**: Add a comment clarifying that `valid_validators` is an assumed field that would need to be added to the Verifier contract state for this specific extension.
2.  **Assumptions in Conceptual Code (React - Intent History)**:
    - **Issue**: The `IntentHistory` React component example calls `nearConnection.contract.get_user_intents({ user_account: accountId })`. This method (`get_user_intents`) was not defined in the Verifier contract during the workshop.
    - **Expected**: Add a note explaining that the `get_user_intents` view method would need to be implemented on the Verifier contract (or data fetched from an off-chain database/indexer) for this history component to function as shown.
3.  **Assumptions in Conceptual Code (Rust - RefFinanceSolver)**:
    - **Issue**: The conceptual Rust code for integrating with Ref Finance uses external traits (`ext_ref_finance`), structs (`Pool`), and constants (`Gas`, `TGAS`) without showing their definitions or imports.
    - **Expected**: Add comments indicating that `ext_ref_finance` and `Pool` would need to be defined based on Ref Finance's actual contract interface and that `Gas`/`TGAS` require standard imports (`use near_sdk::Gas; const TGAS: u64 = ...;`).

### `03-wrap-up.md`

1.  **Image Path Verification**:
    - **Issue**: Contains an image link: `![Workshop Completion Certificate](../images/workshop-completion.png)`.
    - **Expected**: Verify that the relative path `../images/workshop-completion.png` correctly points to the image file from the location of `03-wrap-up.md` within the project structure.
