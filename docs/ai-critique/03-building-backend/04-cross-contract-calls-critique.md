# Critique for 03-building-backend/04-cross-contract-calls.md (Web2 dev perspective)

## Overall Impression

This section focuses specifically on the mechanism of cross-contract calls, which was briefly introduced in the Verifier section. It revisits the `#[ext_contract]` macro and the actual call pattern. This repetition is good for reinforcing a complex and crucial concept. For a Web2 developer, this is akin to one microservice calling another, but with added blockchain-specific considerations like gas and asynchronicity via Promises.

## What Doesn't Work / Needs Clarification

1.  **Overview: "In NEAR, cross-contract calls are asynchronous..."**

    - **Critique**: Good and important statement.
    - **Suggestion**: Briefly reiterate _why_ they are asynchronous (e.g., "due to the distributed nature of the blockchain and the need for transactions to be processed and achieve consensus across the network before results are available.")

2.  **Step 1: Add the External Solver Interface (`#[ext_contract(ext_solver)] trait Solver`)**

    - **Critique**: This repeats the code from `02-intent-verifier.md`. This is fine for a focused section.
    - **Suggestion**: Perhaps add a note: "As introduced in the Verifier implementation, this trait defines the public interface of the Solver contract that we want to call."

3.  **Step 2: Add `verify_and_solve` Method**

    - **Critique**: Again, this method was introduced before. The focus here is its role in _connecting_ the two contracts.
    - **Suggestion**:
      - `intent.user_account.parse().expect("Invalid user_account format")`: The `.expect()` here will cause a panic if parsing fails. For production code, a more graceful error handling (e.g., `Result` type and `?` operator or `match`) might be preferred. While fine for an example, it's good to note. "The `.parse().expect(...)` converts the string `user_account` into an `AccountId` type. If parsing fails (e.g., invalid account format), the contract will panic. In production, you might handle this error more gracefully."
      - Parameters to `ext_solver::solve_intent`: Gas (`5_000_000_000_000`) and deposit (`0`) are reiterated. This is good.

4.  **Step 3: Deploy and Test**

    - **Critique**: Clear instructions for rebuilding, deploying the _updated_ verifier, and calling the new method via NEAR CLI.
    - **Suggestion**:
      - When deploying the updated verifier: Note that if the contract has already been deployed and initialized, a simple `near deploy` updates the code but doesn't re-run the `#[init]` function unless the state is cleared or a migration path is handled. For this example, it's likely fine as the state change in Verifier wasn't critical. "Deploying the updated verifier will replace its existing Wasm code. If the contract was already initialized, its state (like `owner_id`) persists unless explicitly migrated or cleared."
      - The `near call` example is good and shows the nested JSON structure for the `intent` and `solver_account` arguments.

5.  **Best Practices**:
    - **"Ensure the `Intent` struct is consistent between Verifier and Solver contracts."**
      - **Critique**: This is very important. If the structs diverge, serialization/deserialization will fail during the cross-contract call.
      - **Suggestion**: Emphasize this: "If the `Intent` struct definition (fields, types, order) is not identical in both the calling contract (Verifier) and the called contract (Solver), the cross-contract call will likely fail due to serialization errors when passing the `intent` argument."
    - **"Handle failed promise resolutions with callbacks (covered in future sections)."**
      - **Critique**: Excellent point. This is critical for robust applications.
      - **Suggestion**: Briefly explain _why_ callbacks are needed: "Since `solve_intent` returns a `Promise`, the Verifier doesn't immediately know if the Solver succeeded. A callback function is a method on the Verifier that gets invoked by the NEAR runtime after the Solver finishes, allowing the Verifier to react to the Solver's success or failure."
    - **"Use NEAR Explorer to debug logs and view cross-contract traces."**
      - **Critique**: Very practical advice for developers.
      - **Suggestion**: Mention that logs (`env::log_str`) from both Verifier and Solver (if the call reaches it) can be seen in the transaction details on the explorer.

## How to Present Content Better for a Web2 Developer

- **Emphasize Asynchronous Nature & Callbacks**: This is the biggest conceptual hurdle from typical synchronous Web2 backend calls. Continuously reinforce that `Promise` means "this will happen later," and tease the callback mechanism as the way to get results or handle errors from the called contract.
- **Data Consistency (Structs)**: Stress the importance of identical struct definitions for data passed between contracts, similar to how API request/response DTOs must match between services in Web2.
- **Gas as a Resource**: Reiterate that gas is not just for the initial call but also for the execution of the called contract (`solve_intent`) and any further calls it might make.
- **Error Handling in Distributed Systems**: Relate the need for callbacks and error handling to patterns in distributed systems where remote calls can fail and the calling service needs to be aware of or react to these failures.
- **Tooling for Debugging**: Highlighting NEAR Explorer is good. If there are local development tools that simulate cross-contract calls and show traces, mentioning them would also be beneficial.

This section is well-focused on a single, important mechanism. The key for a Web2 developer is to understand the implications of this asynchronous, gas-metered, and potentially fallible communication pattern between smart contracts.
