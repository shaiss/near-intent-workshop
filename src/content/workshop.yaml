# Frequently Asked Questions
faqs:
  - question: "What makes Intents different from regular transactions?"
    answer: "Intents represent what users want to achieve rather than how to achieve it. Unlike traditional transactions where users specify exact steps, intents allow the network to determine the optimal execution path, creating more flexibility and better user experiences."
  - question: "Do I need to know Rust for this workshop?"
    answer: "While having some Rust knowledge is helpful for smart contract development, the workshop provides code samples and explanations that you can follow even without deep Rust experience. We focus more on the concepts and architecture than advanced language features."
  - question: "How does this apply to existing NEAR applications?"
    answer: "Existing applications can gradually adopt the Intent architecture to improve user experience. The workshop includes sections on migration strategies and how to blend traditional and intent-based approaches in your application."
