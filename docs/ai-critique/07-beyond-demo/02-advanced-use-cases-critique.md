# Critique for 07-beyond-demo/02-advanced-use-cases.md (Web2 dev perspective)

## Overall Impression

This section presents several advanced use cases for intent architecture, including DeFi access, cross-chain swaps, wallet abstraction/session UX, and DAO integration. It provides high-level intent structures and some conceptual code snippets for each. This is good for showcasing the potential and versatility of the system.

## What Doesn't Work / Needs Clarification

**General Note**: Many of the intent structures and code snippets here introduce new fields, concepts, or rely on external libraries/services (like Chain Signatures, OmniBridge, AstroDAO) that haven't been fully detailed or integrated into the core workshop flow built so far. This is expected for an "advanced use cases" section, but it's important to frame them as extensions or applications of the core principles rather than things the previously built Verifier/Solver can handle out-of-the-box.

1.  **Use Case 1: Unified DeFi Access**

    - **Intent Structure**: Includes `slippage` directly in `input`, `preference: "best_rate"` in `output`, and `max_gas`, `timeout` in `constraints`. These are good, practical fields.
    - **Implementation Flow**: Mentions "NEAR Intents Manager" (is this a specific service/contract, or a general concept?) and Solvers like "Defuse, custom AMM agents." This implies a sophisticated solver ecosystem.
    - **Live Examples**: Linking to live examples is excellent.
    - **Suggestion**: Clarify if the `Intent` structure shown here would require modifications to the basic Verifier/Solver built earlier (likely yes, to understand `preference`, `max_gas`, etc.).

2.  **Use Case 2: Cross-Chain Token Swaps**

    - **Intent Structure**: Introduces `action: "cross_chain_swap"` with nested `source` and `destination` objects (specifying chain, token, amount) and a `security` object (`timeout`, `fallback`). This is a very different structure.
    - **Key Components**: "Chain Signatures," "OmniBridge," "Atomic Fulfillment." These are significant pieces of infrastructure.
      - `Chain Signatures`: Allows NEAR accounts to control accounts/assets on other chains.
      - `OmniBridge`: A specific bridging protocol. (Is this a general example, or is the workshop tied to OmniBridge?)
      - `Atomic Fulfillment`: Crucial but very hard for cross-chain.
    - **Implementation Guide (JS)**: Shows initializing `ChainSignatures` and `chainSignatures.signIntent(crossChainIntent)`.
      - **Critique**: This `signIntent` from `ChainSignatures` is different from previous notions of signing. It seems to be a signature that authorizes the cross-chain operation via the Chain Signatures infrastructure.
      - **Suggestion**: Explain that `ChainSignatures` is a specific NEAR protocol feature. The intent here is likely processed by a specialized system that understands this `ChainSignatures` protocol, rather than the generic Verifier/Solver built in the workshop core.

3.  **Use Case 3: Wallet Abstraction and Session UX**

    - **Session Key Implementation (JS object `sessionKey`)**: This defines a session key with `publicKey`, `allowance` (an array detailing `receiverId`, `methodNames`, `allowance` in yoctoNEAR), and `maxGas`.
      - **Critique**: This is a good representation of a Function Call Access Key's parameters. The `wallet.requestSignIn({...})` example then shows how a dApp might request such a key when the user signs in.
      - **Suggestion**: This is a clear example. It aligns with how `@near-wallet-selector` can be used with `signIn` to request specific permissions.
    - **Meta-transaction Example (JS object `metaTransaction`)**: Shows a transaction object with `signerId` (user), `receiverId` (contract), and `actions`. Then `wallet.signAndSendTransaction(metaTransaction)`.
      - **Critique**: This example seems to show a standard transaction being signed and sent by the `wallet`. The term "meta-transaction" usually implies that the user signs a _message_ containing the transaction data, and a _relayer_ submits this signed message (paying gas) as an actual transaction to the blockchain. The example here doesn't illustrate the relayer part.
      - **Suggestion**: If this is meant to be a true meta-transaction (for gasless UX), the flow should be: 1. User signs the _intent_ or _transaction data_. 2. This signed data is sent to a Relayer. 3. Relayer wraps it in an actual transaction, signs that _wrapper transaction_ with their own key (paying gas), and submits it. The contract receiving it then needs to verify the user's original signature on the inner data.
        The example as written looks like a normal transaction sent via a wallet that has session key permissions.

4.  **Use Case 4: DAO + Smart Wallets + Intents**

    - **Multisig Contract Implementation (JS object `multisigContract`)**: Shows a conceptual multisig setup with `owners`, `threshold`, and an `intent` (a composed cross-chain yield strategy).
    - **DAO Governance Integration (JS object `daoProposal`)**: Shows creating a DAO proposal that, if passed, would call `execute_intent` on `multisig.near` with the defined intent.
      - **Critique**: This is a powerful example of DAOs managing and executing complex intents via a multisig that acts like a smart wallet.
      - **Suggestion**: Clarify that `multisig.near` would be a smart contract that can hold assets and execute transactions based on owner approvals, and that it would need an `execute_intent` method capable of processing the complex composed intent. `astroDao.submitProposal` refers to a specific DAO platform on NEAR.

5.  **Implementation Resources**: Linking to docs for Chain Signatures, Meta Transactions, FastAuth, and Multichain DAO is very helpful.

## How to Present Content Better for a Web2 Developer

1.  **Contextualize Each Use Case**: For each advanced use case, briefly explain the problem it solves or the new capability it enables compared to simpler Web3 interactions or the basic intent system built in the workshop.
2.  **Distinguish from Core Workshop**: Clearly indicate that these advanced use cases might require additional smart contracts (e.g., a multisig contract, specialized cross-chain intent processors), external services (OmniBridge, Relayers for true meta-tx), or specific NEAR protocols (Chain Signatures, FastAuth) that are beyond the scope of the Verifier/Solver built in the main workshop modules.
3.  **Intent Structure Evolution**: Acknowledge that the `Intent` structure might become more complex or specialized for these advanced cases (e.g., the `cross_chain_swap` intent structure is very different).
4.  **Explain Key Technologies Briefly**: When mentioning things like "Chain Signatures," "OmniBridge," or "AstroDAO," provide a one-sentence explanation of what they are for a Web2 developer encountering them for the first time.
5.  **Meta-transaction Clarity**: If demonstrating meta-transactions for gasless UX, ensure the role of the Relayer and the two levels of signing (user signs message, relayer signs transaction) are clear. The current example is ambiguous.
6.  **Focus on the "What" and "Why"**: Since the "how" for these advanced cases is often very complex, focus on _what_ new user experiences or system capabilities they enable and _why_ they are valuable.

This section is great for inspiring developers by showing the broader potential. The key is to manage expectations by clarifying that these often involve more than just the simple Verifier/Solver and may rely on a richer ecosystem of tools and services.
