# Critique for 02-understanding-building-blocks/05-checkpoint.md (Web2 dev perspective)

## Overall Impression

This checkpoint is a good idea to help learners pause and consolidate their understanding. It's brief and to the point.

## What Doesn't Work / Needs Clarification

1.  **"Understand the high-level architecture"**:

    - **Critique**: This is a good goal. How can a student self-assess this? What specific architectural components should they be able to recall or explain?
    - **Suggestion**: Be slightly more specific or provide guiding questions. For example:
      - "Can you sketch the main components (User, Intent Object, Verifier, Solver, Smart Wallet) and how they generally interact?"
      - "Could you explain to a colleague new to Web3 why this intent-based architecture is different from typical transaction processing?"

2.  **"Be familiar with the concepts of Verifier, Solver, and Smart Wallet"**:

    - **Critique**: Again, a good goal. "Familiar" is a bit subjective.
    - **Suggestion**: Prompt for a specific level of understanding:
      - "Can you describe the primary role of a Verifier? What is its main responsibility?"
      - "What is the main function of a Solver? How does it interact with an Intent?"
      - "What are 1-2 key problems that a Smart Wallet aims to solve for the user?"

3.  **"See the value of abstraction for user-friendly dApps"**:
    - **Critique**: This is about appreciating the "why." It's crucial.
    - **Suggestion**: Prompt for articulation of this value:
      - "Can you list 2-3 ways this abstraction specifically improves the experience for an end-user compared to traditional Web3 interactions?"
      - "From a developer's perspective, what are the potential benefits of building with this abstracted architecture?"

## How to Present Content Better for a Web2 Developer

- **Actionable Self-Assessment**: Frame the checkpoint items as questions the learner can try to answer. This makes self-assessment more concrete.
- **Link Back to Key Concepts**: Briefly remind them where these concepts were covered if they feel unsure (e.g., "Recall the roles of Verifier and Solver from section 2.1 and 2.2").
- **Connect to Web2 Experience (If Applicable)**: For understanding the value of abstraction, they can think about abstractions they already use in Web2 (e.g., ORMs for databases, high-level framework APIs) and how those simplify development or improve UX.
- **Optional: Quick Quiz/Review**: For a more formal checkpoint, consider adding 2-3 multiple-choice or short-answer questions (though this might be beyond the scope of a markdown file, it can be a suggestion for the workshop platform).
- **Encourage Review**: Add a line like, "If any of these points are unclear, now is a great time to revisit the previous sections in this module before moving on."

Checkpoints are most effective when they actively engage the learner in recalling and applying what they've learned, rather than just passively acknowledging the topics covered. Making the checkpoint questions more specific and actionable will enhance their value, especially for someone navigating many new Web3 concepts.
